## joel

A very simple Discord music bot.

This bot was created with the intent of just playing around with ~~Rust~~ Elixir, it lacks a lot of features. The main purpose with this is to just play music for a small server with friends and post JOEL whenever He is needed.

## Slash commands

`joel`, `ttj`, `play`, `stop`, `pause`, `resume`, `leave`

## Requirements

Since heroku stopped offering a free tier, you will have to use other alternatives to host this bot.

This bot requires `yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg`.

```bash
apt install ffmpeg yt-dlp
```

Enable the Message Content intent in the Discord Developer Portal.

## Todo

-   More JOEL (very important)
