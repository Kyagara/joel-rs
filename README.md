## music-rs

A simple Discord music bot written in Rust.

This bot was created with the intent of just playing around with Rust _(pretty fun so far!)_ and lacks some features like having a DJ role.

Some friends needed a simple discord bot for music so I decided to make this and make a deploy button on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) in case someone might need this bot too.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Kyagara/music-rs)

After adding the bots environment variables and clicking to deploy, check the build logs and wait, it will take some time to build and to start the bot. The bot will automatically start a worker dyno.
